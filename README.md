# foodforfont
I originally created this project as a fun collaborative effort between Zach and I, combining his love for food and mine for typography. First, I designed and printed recipe cards as a gift for him one year for Christmas when I was in grad school at CMU (and flat broke). One day, I decided to revisit it and make it an online recipe box.
